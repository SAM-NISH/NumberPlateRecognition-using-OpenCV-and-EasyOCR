This project is a comprehensive implementation of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using the powerful computer vision library OpenCV and the efficient Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool EasyOCR. ANPR plays a crucial role in various applications such as traffic management, law enforcement, and parking systems. This repository provides a robust solution for extracting and recognizing license plate information from images.

Features
License Plate Detection: Utilizes OpenCV's computer vision techniques to accurately locate license plates within images.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Employs EasyOCR for highly accurate and multilingual character recognition on the extracted license plate region.
